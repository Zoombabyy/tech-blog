## Installation

If you would like to install this project on your local computer, make sure you have a database you can run the seeds into. Make sure you read the script and seeds code, as well as run an `npm install`.

This project is hosted on Heroku and utilizes JawsDB. The .env is not uploaded to GitHub for security reasons, but to fully replicate this website on a cloud-based platform, you will need to generate a connection string in order to seed the data through a database on such a platform as Heroku.

## Usage

The application is deployed on Heroku at https://tech-blog-homewrk.herokuapp.com/

Visit the website on Heroku. You can view posts and visit links as a visitor, create your own account, and as an authenticated user you can add your own posts and comment on other posts as well. You can edit titles and content or delete your own posts as well. You can also update your username, email, and password.
